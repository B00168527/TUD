The flag for this challenge was the "Randomness" data in the paclet sent from cryptohack.org in the "ServerHello" message.
To find it, I first got all the packets sent from cryptohack.org (178.62.74.206) and then found the Server Hello message.
In this, I found the randomness value and entered it as the flag.
