The challenge provided a very clear hint to XOR the two images of the RGB bytes of the two files and to ignore the metadata values. 
To solve the challenge, I loaded the 2 files into my python code. I then extracted each pixels RGB values and XOR'ed it with the corresponding value of the other image. 
The result was saved into a new PNG which revealed the flag.
