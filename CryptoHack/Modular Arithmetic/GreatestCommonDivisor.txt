To solve this challenege, I used the Euclid's Algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor. 
The function I created has a while loop which runs while a is not equal to be. If they are equal, a is returned to provide the GCD.
If they are not equal, the enxt line checks if a is greater than b, if yes, a is recalculated to be the value of a - b. We do the same for b if a is less than b. 
Passing the challenge values into this method resulted in the correct answer
