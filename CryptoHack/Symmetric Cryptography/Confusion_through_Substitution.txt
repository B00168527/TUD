The solution to this challenge was simply to subsitute in the value in the sbox in the position of the value of s[row][column]. 
The code create a temp matrix to store the result, and loops over each row and column of s. 
The temp matrix is then filled with the value in the index of sbox which matches the value of s[row][column]. 
matrix2bytes is then used to retrieve the flag from the temp matrix.
