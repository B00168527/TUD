To find the flag, I first encrypted 16 null bytes to get the encrypted IV which is also the key.
Next I decrypted this first encrypted value with 16 null bytes before it which caused the key to be decrypted. They key is taken from the second block which was the original encrypted value. 
I then passed this key value in the get_flag function which returned some hex. I simply converted this hex to plaintext to read the flag.
