To find the key used, I first downloaded the list of words from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/wchargin/8927565/raw/d9783627c731268fb2935a731a618aa8e95cf465/words
The list was then imported into the python code and each word was stored in a list. 
The code looped through the list of each word hashing it using hashlib. 
The ciphertext and hashed word were passed into the "decrypt" funciton provided by the challenge.
The code uses the "codecs" library to decode the result into ASCII. If the decoding was successful, the word and plaintext of the ciphertext were printed out. The code exits the loop and finishes.
