To discover the flag for this challenge, I did not need to write any code. 
From reading online, I found that DES has some weak keys such as "0000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF".
I simply entered this weak key into the "encrypt_flag" function. 
I copied the output from this encryption into they plaintext value of the "encrypt" function, while once again using "0000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" as the key. 
The output from this was the flag in hex. I then used the hex to plaintext option on the page to convert it to the readable key.
