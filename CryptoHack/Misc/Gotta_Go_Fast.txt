To solve the challenge, I first connect to the server and retrieve the encrypted value.
The server encrypts the flag using a key that's just a SHA-256 hash of the current Unix timestamp "time.time()". 
I take that encrypted flag and try to decrypt it by re-encrypting it using the exact same logic the server used which will XOR with the same key twice and decrypt the flag. 
To do this, I generate a key using my own time.time() function. 
If the time matches exactly then my re-encryption reveals the original flag. 
The code loops until the same time is used and then prints the flag.
