The challenge provided me with values for g, p, A, b and B. 
I verified in the code that B matched the value given by calling "B = pow(g, b, p)".

To find the other shared secret, I used the forumla "A^b mod p" which in python is "pow(A, b, p)".
The resulting value is the other shared secret which was the flag.
