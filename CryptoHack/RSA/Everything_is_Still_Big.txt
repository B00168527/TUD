The solution to this challenge was to use the same code as the "Everything is Big" challenge. 
The vulnerability created from the source code was that d is randomly chosen to be small. 
I just updated the N, e and c values which were used by the owiener library to calculate "d".
After "d" was calculated, I used "pow(c, d, N)" to calculate the flag and print it out.
