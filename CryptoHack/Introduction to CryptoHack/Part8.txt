By following the help provided on the challenge: 

Commutative: A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
Associative: A ⊕ (B ⊕ C) = (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C
Identity: A ⊕ 0 = A
Self-Inverse: A ⊕ A = 0

In all the XOR's, I make sure to convert the hex to bytes. 
I first XOR'd the KEY1 with KEY2 ^ KEY1
Next, I XOR'd "KEY2 ^ KEY3" with "KEY2 ^ KEY1"

Finally, I XOR'd the flag value with the results of XOR'ing all the XOR'd values from above which provided me with the answer.
