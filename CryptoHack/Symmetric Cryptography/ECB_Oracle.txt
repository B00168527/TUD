To capture this flag, the code exploits the weakness of ECB in that identical plaintext blocks are identical when encrypted. 
The code loops through all possible letters for the cryptohack flag value and compares it's encrypted block to the encrpyted block of the compare value. 
When the code finds identical blocks, it means that the chars match and it appends that char to the flag. 
When the final char of the cryptohack flags ("}") is found, the code knows that the whole flag has been found and prints it out.
