This challenge involved using the HS256, but the main difficulty was finding the "SECRET_KEY" value used.
The code snippet provided had a comment which inidicated the value was copied from the readme docs of PyJWT which was "secret".
Using this key and the HS256 algortihm, I encoded a JWT which when used on the challenge provided me with flag.
