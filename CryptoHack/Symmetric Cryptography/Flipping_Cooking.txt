Firstly the script retrieves the encrypted cookie from the server, which contains "admin=False;expiry=<timestamp>", encrypted using AES-CBC.
It then locates the "admin=False" text in the expected plaintext and prepares a replacement string ";admin=True;".
The code then uses a bit-flipping attack, which modifies both the IV (first block) and the ciphertext (second block) so that when decrypted, it changes "admin=False" to "admin=True".
The modified IV and ciphertext are sent back to the endpoint which tricks it into believing the user is an admin.
As the system now believes the cookies is for an admin, it returns the correct flag
