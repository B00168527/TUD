I defined a function using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine several ciphertexts (emails) into one congruence modulo the product of the selected moduli. 
By iterating through all combinations of 3 out of the 7 given ciphertexts and moduli, I attempt to reconstruct the original message. 
Since the encryption exponent is small, I take the integer cube root of the CRT result to retrieve the plaintext. 
Finally, I check if the decoded message contains "crypto{", and if it does, I print out the flag.
