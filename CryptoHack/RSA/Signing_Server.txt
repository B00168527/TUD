The code solves the challenge by first connecting to the endpoint and retriveing the secret value.
The secret value is then passed back to the endpoint and signed. 
After retrieving the singed value, I print it out which reveals a hex value. 
The printed string begins with "0x" so I simply copy the string without these characters into an online hex to ASCII site to convert it. 
This then reveals the flag/secret.
