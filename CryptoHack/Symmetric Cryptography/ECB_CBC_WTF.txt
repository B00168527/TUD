To capture the flag, the code first calls the encrypt() method which is a web service call which returns the ciphertext.
The code then splits up the ciphertext into 16 byte blocks but separates the first block as the initialisng vector.
All blocks apart from the first, is then decrypted using the decrypt() method which calls the web service provided by the challenge.
Each block are then XORed with the previous block to reverse the CBC mode. 
Finally, the decoded blocks are combined to reveal the flag.
