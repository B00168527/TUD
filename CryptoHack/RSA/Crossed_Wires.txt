This challenge provided me with an RSA private key (N, d), the public keys of five friends, and a ciphertext that was the result of encrypting a flag through each friend's public key one after the other. 
To reverse this and reveal the flag, I needed to undo all those exponentiations.
First, I multiplied all five of the friends public exponents together to get one big exponent E, since each encryption raised the message to another power modulo N. 
Then, using my private exponent d, I reconstructed φ(N) by calculating phi = e * d - 1, because e * d ≡ 1 mod φ(N).
With φ(N) and the combined exponent E, I computed the modular inverse D = E⁻¹ mod φ(N), which is the exponent that would reverse all of their encryptions. 
Finally, I decrypted the ciphertext with D and printed the flag out.
