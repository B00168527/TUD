From examining the given code, I know that p and q were generated as 2^secret - 1. 
To find p and q, I loop through possible secret values and calculate p each time. 
Next I check if p divides n exactly. If it does, I know I've found one of the primes. 
I then calculate q by q = n // p and use both to calculate φ(n). 
With φ(n), I find the modular inverse of e to get the private key d. 
Finally I decrypt ciphertext using d and print the flag.
