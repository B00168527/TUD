To add the round key, I first created a temp matrix which would store the result. 
A loop was created to loop through each cell of the s and k matricies. 
The value of each cell of s and k were XOR'ed together and the result was stored in the corresponding cell in the temp matrix. 
Finally, the matrix2bytes function created in the previous challenge printed out the flag which was then returned.
